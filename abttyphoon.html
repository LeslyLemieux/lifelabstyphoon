<h2>
  About Typhoon
</h2>
<br>
<p>
A typhoon is something that occurs in different parts of the world. It is a cyclone,<br>
a big and rotating storm, that causes wind, rain, and destruction depending on how<br>
strong it is. This also causes negative impacts to the people and community.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h3>
  Conditions on how a typhoon forms
</h3>
<p>
  • A large part of a warm, tropical ocean water with temperature exceeding 26.5oC<br>
  is the condition needed for a typhoon to form. Then the ocean water would evaporate<br>
  to the atmosphere giving us warm air due to the heat from the Sun.<br>
  • The second condition for forming typhoons would be cold and unstable air above the<br>
  water surface, so it could meet with the warm air from the evaporation.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  This will start forming clouds. Then the warm air would push the cold air downwards<br>
  as it moves forward, this will create two kinds of pressures: high pressure area<br>
  (from the presence of cold and dense air) and low pressure area (from the presence<br>
  of hot and humid air). Spiraling winds around the center or something we call the eye<br>
  of the storm is produced as the meeting of the cold and warm air continues. This will<br>
  form a tropical depression. This tropical depression can develop into something stronger:<br>
  tropical depression > storm > typhoon, and in some cases, even super typhoon.<br>
</p>

<br><br>
<h3>
  How do landforms and bodies of water affect typhoons?
</h3>
<p>
  • Mountains help slow down typhoons since they block the movement of the air and rain<br>
  of the typhoon. The altitude of the mountain is also helped because this would force the<br>
  typhoon to release on only one side of the mountain. In general, land reduces the intensity<br>
  of the typhoon since the main source of typhoons is water. And land.. is of course.. not water.<br>

<h3>
  Why is the Philippines prone to typhoons?
</h3>
<p>
  • Now that we’ve discussed what a typhoon is and how it develops, let’s move on to something<br>
  more specific to our country. You might have a question along the lines of why is the Philippines<br>
  prone to typhoons? Well, just like mentioned earlier, typhoons need a large part of a warm,<br>
  ocean water. And you know, the Philippines is a tropical island— basically surrounded with water,<br>
  and has a warm climate. Everything you need for a typhoon to formulate. So that’s why.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Now what is the general path of the typhoon that enters the PAR? But first, let’s understand what<br>
  PAR is, PAR is the Philippine Area of Responsibility, which is, according to research, “This<br>
  is the smallest and innermost monitoring domain, whose boundary is closest to the Philippine<br>
  Islands.” So what IS the general path of the typhoon that enters the PAR? It is usually west-northwest.<br>
  The reason behind this is the trade winds from the intertropical convergence zone, which is<br>
  basically the region that circles Earth near the Equator where the trade winds of the Northern<br>
  and Southern Hemispheres come together.<br>
